# MIS381N-Data-Science-Programming
These are the projects from my MSBA Data Science Programming class. The HW assingments are trying to solve a problem using Python, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib fundamentals.
The final project is applying ML models to a datset of my choosing and going through an entire project pipeline - from data cleaning, EDA, modeling, and conclusions.
